How to install

pip install py3cw
```

How to use

```python
from py3cw.request import Py3CW

# request_options is optional, as all the keys from the dict
# so you can only change what you want.
# default options for request_options are:
# request_timeout: 30s (30 for connect, 30 for read)
# nr_of_retries: 5
# retry_status_codes: [500, 502, 503, 504]
# NOTE: Nr of retries and retry_status_codes will also be used if we get 
# an falsy success from 3 commas (eg: { "error": { "status_code": 502 }})
p3cw = Py3CW(
    key='', 
    secret='',
    request_options={
        'request_timeout': 10,
        'nr_of_retries': 1,
        'retry_status_codes': [502]
    }
)

# With no action
# Destruct response to error and data
# and check first if we have an error, otherwise check the data
error, data = p3cw.request(
    entity='smart_trades_v2',
    action=''
)

# With payload data
# Destruct response to error and data
# and check first if we have an error, otherwise check the data
error, data  = p3cw.request(
    entity='smart_trades_v2', 
    action='new', 
    payload={
        "account_id": 123456,
        ......
    }
)

# With action_id replaced in URL
# Destruct response to error and data
# and check first if we have an error, otherwise check the data
error, data = p3cw.request(
    entity='smart_trades_v2', 
    action='get_by_id',
    action_id='123456'
)
```

An `entity` represents main categories. Meaning, you have `accounts`, `bots`, `marketplace`, `deals` or `smart_trades`

An `action` is represented by a ... well, an action of a specific category. There are multiple actions you can use (check 3commas API)

`action_id` is used to replace the necessary account_id or bot_id or deal_id (you get the picture) needed on some actions. For example the `action` `sell_all_to_btc` requires the `account_id` (`POST /ver1/accounts/{account_id}/load_balances`)

`payload` is the data you send.

[Forced mode header](https://github.com/3commas-io/3commas-official-api-docs#api-modesreal-or-paper) could be added with the parameter `additional_headers`. Allowed values are 'real' or 'paper'. E.g. 
`... additional_headers={'Forced-Mode': 'paper'} ...`
