*** 

An `entity` represents main categories. Meaning, you have `accounts`, `bots`, `marketplace`, `deals` or `smart_trades`

An `action` is represented by a ... well, an action of a specific category. There are multiple actions you can use (check 3commas API)

`action_id` is used to replace the necessary account_id or bot_id or deal_id (you get the picture) needed on some actions. For example the `action` `sell_all_to_btc` requires the `account_id` (`POST /ver1/accounts/{account_id}/load_balances`)

`payload` is the data you send.
